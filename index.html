            Clash of Clans is a 2012 free-to-play mobile strategy video game
            developed and published by Finnish game developer Supercell. The
            game was released for iOS platforms on August 2, 2012, and on Google
            Play for Android on October 7, 2013.
          </p>
          <p>
            Clash of Clans is an online multiplayer game in which each player is
            a village chief. Every player builds their village by using
            resources and trains troops to attack other player villages to gain
            resources and trophies. Players can (and usually do) form
            communities called clans, which are groups of upto 50 people. Clans
            players can donate troops to each other and can go on war with other
            clans. There are four currencies or resources in the game: Gold,
            Elixir, Dark Elixir, Gems. Gold and elixir are used to build and
            upgrade buildings like defenses, resource collectors etc. Elixir and
            Dark Elixir are also used to upgrade troops and spells. In the past,
            they were also used to train the troops but since July 2022 training
            is made free. Gems are the premium currency. They can be earned by
            completing in-game achievements or bought using real money. Attacks
            are rated on a three-star scale and have a maximum timed length of
            three minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game is set in a fantasy-themed persistent world where the
            player is a chief of a village. Clash of Clans tasks players to
            build their own village using the resources gained from attacking
            other players' villages with troops, earning rewards, buying them
            with medals or by producing them at their own village. Players can
            conjoin to create clans - groups of up to fifty people - who can
            then participate in Clan Wars together, donate and receive troops,
            and chat with each other. Clash of Clans was released to generally
            positive reviews from critics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Four spin-off games in the same universe of Clash of Clans were
            developed by Supercell. The first, Clash Royale, was released in
            2016. The other three, Clash Quest, Clash Mini, and Clash Heroes,
            were announced in April 2021. Clash Quest development was
            discontinued on 17 August 2022.
